<summary><strong>About Encryption and Decryption 🛡️</strong></summary>

**Encryption** and **decryption** are fundamental concepts in cybersecurity and data protection.

**Encryption** is the process of converting *plaintext* data into *ciphertext*, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. This is typically achieved using algorithms and keys. Only authorized users with the correct **decryption key** can transform the *ciphertext* back into its original *plaintext* form.

**Decryption** is the reverse process of **encryption**. It involves converting the encrypted *ciphertext* back into its original *plaintext* using the correct **decryption key**.

**Real-World Use Case:** One common use case for **encryption** is secure communication over the internet. When you make a purchase online or log in to your bank account, your sensitive information is **encrypted** before being sent over the network. This ensures that even if intercepted, the data remains secure and unreadable to anyone without the **decryption key**.

For more information about the **encryption** method we are implementing, check out the [Caesar Cipher Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

<summary><strong>About the Assignment 📝</strong></summary>

In this assignment, students are tasked with implementing two methods within the `caesar_cipher.c` file. They must provide the implementation for the following methods:

1. **`caesar_encrypt`:** This method should take a *plaintext* message and a *key* as input, and encrypt the message using the **Caesar cipher** algorithm.
   
2. **`caesar_decrypt`:** This method should take a *ciphertext* message and a *key* as input, and decrypt the message using the **Caesar cipher** algorithm.

Students are only allowed to modify the `caesar_cipher.c` file to implement these methods. All other files and functionalities should remain untouched.

For more information about the Caesar cipher encryption method, please refer to the [Caesar Cipher Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

<summary><strong>What You Need to Do ✅</strong></summary>

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Implement the Methods**: Navigate to the `src/caesar_cipher.c` file and implement the `caesar_encrypt` and `caesar_decrypt` methods as instructed.

3. **Build the Code**: Once you've implemented the methods, build the code using the make command in the terminal:

   ```make```
4. **Test Your Code**: Use the make test command to run the test suite and ensure your implementations are correct:

   ```make test```

Follow these steps carefully to complete the assignment. Happy coding! 🚀

<summary><strong>Final Steps: Commit and Push Your Changes 🚀</strong></summary>

If everything looks good and your code is working as expected, it's time to commit and push your changes to the repository.

1. **Add Changes**: Add all modified files to the staging area using the following command:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement Caesar cipher encryption and decryption methods"
   git push origin main
   ```
